# Complete Guide to Test Chrome Extensions with Puppeteer

This is a complete example on how to test a chrome extension with Puppeteer. This repo is referenced [in our blog](https://tweak-extension.com/blog/complete-guide-test-chrome-extension-puppeteer). In this repo you can find:

* A simple chrome extension under `replacer-chrome-extension`.
* A simple React app under `src`.
* Puppeteer e2e tests under `e2e`.

## Instructions

1. `npm install` to install the dependencies.
2. `npm start` to run the react app, must be running since it is the base for the e2e tests.
3. `npm run e2e` to run the e2e tests.
